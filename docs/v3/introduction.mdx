## What is Trigger.dev (v3)?

Trigger.dev v3 makes it easy to write reliable long-running tasks without timeouts.

- We run your tasks with no timeouts, you don't have to deploy or manage infrastructure (unless you [self-host](/v3/self-hosting)).
- We provide an SDK and CLI for writing tasks inside your existing codebase, inside `/trigger` folders.
- We provide different triggers for your tasks, like HTTP, Cron, Webhooks, and more.
- We provide a dashboard for monitoring, debugging, and managing your tasks.

We're [open source](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/trigger.dev) and you can choose to use the [Trigger.dev Cloud](https://cloud.trigger.dev) or [Self-host Trigger.dev](/v3/self-hosting) on your own infrastructure.
