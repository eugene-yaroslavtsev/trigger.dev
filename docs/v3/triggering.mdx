| `task.triggerAndWait()`      | Triggers a task and then waits until it's complete. You get the result data to continue with.                                      |
| `task.batchTriggerAndWait()` | Triggers a task multiple times in parallel and then waits until they're all complete. You get the resulting data to continue with. |

You can trigger tasks from other tasks, including being able to wait for the result of the triggered task. This is a powerful way to build complex workflows.

```ts
import { task } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";

export const helloWorld = task({
  id: "hello-world",
  run: async (payload: { message: string }) => {
    console.log("Hello world task is running with payload", payload);

    return { message: "bar" };
  },
});

export const triggerHelloWorld = task({
  id: "trigger-hello-world",
  run: async (payload, { ctx }) => {
    //Trigger the helloWorld task
    const result = await helloWorld.triggerAndWait({ payload: { message: "foo" } });

    //Will log out "Bar"
    console.log(result.message);

    //Return the result of the helloWorld task
    return result;
  },
});
```
